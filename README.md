# AzureFirewallARM

deployed a jump box and a simulated production server and then configured the Azure Firewall to only allow access to GitHub.com from the production server. You then tested by accessing the production server from a Jumpbox and connected to GitHub successfully and abc.com unsucessfully because it is blocked.
